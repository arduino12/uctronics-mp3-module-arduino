# uctronics-mp3-module-arduino
This is my Arduino Player library!

Copy the "Player" library folder to your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder.
Restart the IDE (close and open again).

Then in Arduino IDE:
File -> Examples -> Player -> simple.
File -> Examples -> Player -> mp3Player.

Follow the connection instructions at the beginning of each sample!
In addition I've included a picture that illustrates the connections.

I bought this mp3-module from electronics_lee:

Enjoy :)
